### Design Concept

This project is part of the FCC challenges within the Responsive Web Design section. The styles are from ClusterCSS, a minimal Sass framework developed by myself. All the Sass code is compiled into CSS using Gulp4 as a build tool.
A dark theme together with white text and a vibrant primary color, ensure "no distraction" for the user who needs to go through the document. The page is fully responsive.

### Live Demo
